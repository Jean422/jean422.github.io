Currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Applied Business Analytics** at **Boston University**, I’m sharpening my skills in transforming complex datasets into actionable solutions that drive meaningful business outcomes.

## 💡 What I Bring to the Table

With hands-on experience across industries — from FMCG and banking to AI — I have contributed to:

- 📊 Data analysis & visualization (SQL, Python, R, Power BI, Tableau)  
- 📈 Market research & strategic planning  
- ⚙️ Process optimization & automation  
- ☁️ Cloud-based analytics (AWS)

These experiences have taught me how to navigate dynamic environments, balance analytical precision with creative problem-solving, and communicate insights that influence decision-makers.

## 🎯 My Career Goal

My goal is to **bridge the gap between data and decision-making**, empowering organizations to achieve their strategic objectives through informed insights.

I thrive in collaborative, forward-thinking teams, and I’m especially excited about projects that use data to tackle real-world challenges in business, sustainability, and innovation.
